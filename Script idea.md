You see rebels rushing into the hangar, Kleiner and Magnusson run in and the room fills, just as Gordon closes his eyes you see a man in a suit make his way through the crowd.
You just see the Gman look down at you. Everything is dark, then after a second the Gman slowly appears in front of you, you look around everything is dark, the Gman begins to speak,
“Doctor Freeman, the time has come Doctor Freeman, [insert Gman speech here]” as the Gman talks the surroundings change to the Combine home world, the rebels aboard the Borealis,
multiple other cities with citadels falling down, the remaining combine fighting some rebels. The Gman tells you that your work is not yet done.
Half-Life 3 appears on screen in bold writing and then slowly fades away.

You wake up without your HEV suit in what seems to be a dark room of combine architecture but filled with rebel stuff, as though they have taken it over.
Light fills the room through a window and you notice you are on a train, one made by the combine but taken over and used by the rebels. A door is left ajar, it opens upon walking towards
it and reveals a similar room with weapons and combine armour re-painted with lambdas and rebel insignia. You hear noise coming from the next room, as you go through you see Cubbage
and some rebels arguing over torturing remaining combine units, he does not expect Gordon to be there and is angry until he realises who it is, he says he thought you were dead and that
no one had seen him for years, he begins to shout and doesn’t believe your real, as he walks out you faintly hear him mumbling something about “him” to himself. You are left with the
rebels, one starts saying they should call someone with a name you don’t recognise, implying he is the head of the rebellion now, another who is clearly higher ranked firmly says no,
that Cubbage will decide what happens to him, one who is significantly younger than the rest asks about Kleiner, but is shut up quickly with harsh looks from the others. You are told
by one of the higher ranking rebels that you should not have hid from them or come on the train at all, you are then pushed into a small room where for a minute or two you can see
the fields of eastern Europe flash by, with debris all over the place and the remains of combine structures. You hear rebels go past your room and notice under the bed a trap door
meant for maintenance. You open it and crawl through the underside of the train, you see through a crack in the floor Colonel Cubbage’s office where he is talking to the head of
the rebellion, he is of corse talking about you, they don’t want other people to find out that you are still alive, “Bring Gordon to me,” the leader of the resistance says,
“Maybe Kleiner and Magnusson will show once they know”. The tunnel ends at what you realise is the engine room at the back of the train, there are a few rebels with AR2s and a shotgun,
you crouch and sneak past unnoticed. The engine carriage is seperate from the rest of the train and has an exposed area that you must through something into, thick black smoke then
rises from the engine and you hear the rebels stir and come over to check on whats going on, quickly you must run to the end to get away. the rebels are shouting “FREEMAN!!”,
“NO FREEMAN GET AWAY FROM THERE!!”. A commanding officer yells at the rebels to take fire, bullet holes cover the carriage in seconds and something explodes, causing the engine
carriage to detach from the main train, which is severely damaged from the explosion, it starts to slow and then tips.

Gordon's carriage travels backwards at a very fast rate. Sparks fly from the wheels and after a few miles in about two minutes an explosion from the engine sends you into the dirt.
You wake and see a building in the distance and go that way. Upon arrival you notice it's a rebel base and you see helicopters flying by and lots of activity going on around it.
A portal storm hits and starts sending things everywhere.

Scratch most of that, the combine attack while Gordon is at the engine and take Gordon but no one else just revel leader thinks you are working with combine and might tell all Rebels
